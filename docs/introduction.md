# Introduction to NoverFly

NoverFly is a **cloud-native SaaS platform** that brings together website building, application development, content management, e-commerce, a cloud database (BaaS), and AI-powered tools into one seamless experience.

## Why NoverFly?

Building an online presence typically requires juggling multiple tools:
- A website builder (Webflow, Wix)
- An application builder (Bubble, Retool)
- An e-commerce platform (Shopify, WooCommerce)
- A CMS (Contentful, Strapi)
- A backend database / BaaS (Firebase, Supabase)
- A hosting provider (Vercel, Netlify)
- Analytics tools (Google Analytics, Mixpanel)

**NoverFly replaces all of them** with a single platform.

## Multi-Tenant Architecture

NoverFly uses a **shared-database, tenant-isolated** architecture:

- Each user can belong to multiple **organizations (tenants)**
- Data is isolated per tenant using a `tenantId` foreign key
- API requests require an `X-Tenant-Id` header for tenant-scoped operations
- Users can switch between tenants seamlessly from the dashboard
